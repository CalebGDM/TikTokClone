#### Reflection
This was a very simple and fast to develop learning app. Project goals included using tecnologis learned up untill this point such as JavaScript and React Native as well 
learn new technologies like aws amplify and S3 Storage.

One of the main challenges I ran was accessing to the device camera and microphone. This led me to spend a few days researching the official expo documentation and various internet forums.

But at the end of the day it was a very fun activity and I learned a lot about the new technologies used in this project.
